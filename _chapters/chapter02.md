title: Warranting and Chain of Command
---
The Kingdom Webminister shall: act as the recognizing authority for the Kingdom's internet sites; be responsible for overseeing the Kingdom-level internet site; maintain a roster of recognized branch sites for the Kingdom; monitor those sites for compliance with applicable SCA and Kingdom policies; and report on such to the Society Webminister.

Kingdom officers must be warranted. Officers are legal agents of the corporation and should be officially recognized as such. The warrant proves agency and standing in office. If you are an officer of this corporation, acts performed in your official capacity are covered by its insurance, and the SCA has an obligation to indemnify you. Therefore, Kingdom Webministers, and their deputies, must be warranted. Warrant forms can be found in Appendix B of the Governing Documents of the Society for Creative Anachronism, Inc. (Corpora), and on the SCAâ€™s web site. Warrants for Kingdom Webministers must be signed by the Crown and the Society Webminister.

The chain of command is:

- Publications Manager, SCA Inc
  - Webminister, SCA Inc
    - Kingdom Webminister
      - Principality Webminister (where applicable)
        - Branch Webminister (reports to both Principality and Kingdom Webministers, unless specified in kingdom law)
      - Branch Webminister
